# Terraform AWS Web Server Setup

This project automates the deployment of a web server on AWS using Terraform. The infrastructure includes an EC2 instance running Apache, hosted within a secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Public access is enabled using an Elastic IP, allowing users to reach the server from the internet.

## Key Features
- **Terraform as Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC):** Manage and deploy cloud infrastructure efficiently.
- **Apache Web Server:** Pre-configured to run on an EC2 instance for immediate web hosting.
- **VPC Setup:** Ensures secure access control and network segmentation.
- **Elastic IP:** Provides a static public IP for accessing the web server.

This setup demonstrates how Terraform simplifies cloud management, automating the creation and configuration of resources on AWS.
